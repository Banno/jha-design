# Dialog

Dialogs inform users about critical information, require users to make decisions, or encapsulate multiple tasks within a discrete process. Use dialogs sparingly because they are interruptive in natureâ€“their sudden appearance forces users to stop their current task and refocus on the dialog content. Not every choice, setting, or detail warrant such interruption and prominence.
