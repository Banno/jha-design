# Compiling CSS

JHA Design uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to build the framework. It does handy things like compile our Sass to CSS, compress images and run tests. To use it, install the required dependencies as directed and then run some Gulp commands.

## Installation

First you'll need [NPM](http://nodejs.org/download/) and [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)

Once you have NPM and node.js, `cd` to this directory and type the following commands:

```
npm install
gulp
```

`npm install` will download all of the developer dependencies needed for building this project. `gulp` will build the project.

## Available Gulp commands

`gulp dev` will build the project and start a web server to view documentation at [localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777).
